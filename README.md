## 🧠 Who's This Girl?
Hi! I'm Houda — a software engineer from Tunisia who builds things that (mostly) work. I make mobile and web apps, connect software to real-world devices, and recently decided that understanding AI isn't just for robots and PhDs. So yes, I’m officially on my “learning LLMs and pretending to understand transformers” arc.

### What I actually do:

- 🛠️ Build stuff from scratch — UI, backend, APIs, chaos… then fix it  
- ⚙️ Make hardware and software play nice using **MQTT**, **WebSocket**, and **Electron**  
- 💻 Ship web and mobile apps without crying (much)  
- 🤖 Learn AI/ML so I can eventually blame bad predictions on the model, not me  
- ☕ Turn coffee into commits (and bugs into features)
